# Movies-ETL
####
A company is wanting to hold a hackathon to help determine which movies will do the best in the coming year. Using data from Wikipedia and Kaggle that has been pasted into JSON and CSV files, the company hopes to provide enough resources to any participants to participate in this event. Before the event can be held, however, the data must be cleaned and imported into a database. Using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook, the data is cleaned and placed into dataframes within the first three notebooks. Once placed into dataframes, the data is then merged using Pandas and Python code to make it easier to import to a table. In the final notebook document, the previously created functions and dataframes are refactored and imported to the tables within the Movies Postgres database.
